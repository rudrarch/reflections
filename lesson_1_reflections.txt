How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Allowed to locate the bug and simultaneous swatting.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Check for diff and versions to the same file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Controlled rollback

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Programs compose of multiple files at a time and similarly saving the all required files to the program makes valid sense.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I actually do not have the answer to this one :/

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Should allow one to be more confident definitely.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I am new to everything here, so let's see if we are to be building something then proly version control might be implied or not, will see.
